         <p>Rajaraja's empire encompassed vast territories, including regions of the <strong>Pandya</strong> country, the <strong>Chera
        </strong>country, and <strong>northern Sri Lanka</strong>. He also extended his influence over strategic islands such as 
        Lakshadweep, Thiladhunmadulu atoll, and parts of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. His conquests weren't limited to the south; 
        he also launched successful campaigns against the <em>Western Gangas</em> and the <em>Western Chalukyas</em>, extending Chola 
        authority as far as the Tungabhadra River. In the east, Rajaraja faced fierce opposition from the Telugu Chola king Jata Choda 
        Bhima over control of Vengi. This region held significant strategic importance due to its access to resources and trade routes. 
        The conflict between the two rulers intensified as they vied for dominance in the region, resulting in significant 
        battles and shifting allegiances.</p>
