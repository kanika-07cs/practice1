        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Chicken:In a large bowl, combine yogurt, onions, tomatoes, garlic, ginger, green chilies, cilantro, mint, red 
        chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, salt, and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces and mix well. Cover and let it marinate for at least 1 hour (preferably overnight in the fridge).</li>
        <li>Prepare the Rice:Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 
        minutes,then drain.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked rice, whole spices (cloves, cardamom, bay leaves, cinnamon), 
        and salt.</li>
        <li>Cook until the rice is about 70% done (it should still have a bite). Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the Chicken:In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat some oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken (along 
        with the marinade) and cook until the chicken is cooked through and the oil starts to separate (about 10-15 minutes).</li>
        <li>Layer the Biryani:Once the chicken is cooked, spread half of the partially cooked rice over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle half of the fried onions, cilantro, and mint on top. If using saffron, dissolve it in warm milk and drizzle over 
        the rice.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining rice on top, and repeat the layering with the rest of the fried onions, cilantro, and mint.</li>
        <li>Final Cooking:Cover the pot with a tight lid (you can seal it with dough if desired) and cook on low heat for about 
        25-30 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking.</li>
        <li>Serve:Gently fluff the biryani with a fork before serving. Serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or salad.</li>
        </ol>
