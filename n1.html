    <p style="color:blueviolet; background-color: aquamarine;">College life is known as one of the most memorable years of 
        one<sup>'</sup>s life. It is entirely different from school life. College life exposes us to new experiences and things that 
        we were not familiar with earlier. For some people, college life means enjoying life to the fullest and partying hard. While 
        for others, it is time to get serious about their career and study thoroughly for a brighter future.</p>
